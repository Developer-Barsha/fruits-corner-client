### My projects description:
I made a warehouse website for fruits. Users can login/register and manage their items, such as adding, deleting, updating. Once the user logs-in, the navbar will show sign out button for the user to sign out whenever the user wants to and many options on the nav than any other indivitual visitor will see. If user forgets password he can reset it and can login with google too.
